I searched everywhere for a way to create a rack for a cable modem

Some of the options that I found (none of them ideal)

 - Juniper router with DOCSIS module (hard to find, do not implement latest versions)
 - Simple metal shelf (cumbersome, has yet to be fixed to the shelf itself)

So I went ahead and created my own. 

I bought the following rack from mpja.com
 - BLACK 19" RACK MOUNT CABINET

I then created a 3d model using Tinkercad to serve as a standoff between the rack mount and a disassembled Surfboard SB6141 modem

This was the result after printed
